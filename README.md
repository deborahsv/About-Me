# About-Me
Cover letter

My name is Déborah S. Vieira, and i am 21 years old. I am from Brazil. I completed high school in 2019 and began pursuing a bachelor's degree in Biomedicine. However, I decided to discontinue my studies in Biomedicine with only one year left to finish the program. Despite being close to completion, I realized that I no longer identified with the profession and felt dissatisfied.

I meet computacion science for the freeCodeCamp, and i loved it. I thoght that was impossible for me, because i never was good with exact sciences field, but i learn that dedication and care is more important. I just began, so i don't chose what area i'll follow, i still in the basic (html e css). 

I discovered computer science through freeCodeCamp, and I immediately fell in love with it. Initially, I thought it would be impossible for me to succeed in this field because i had never been proficient in exact sciences. However, I learned that dedication and perseverance are more important than innate talent. I have just started my journey in computer science, currently focusing on the basics such as HTML and CSS.

I am currently seeking an internship opportunity, although I acknowledge that my knowledge in the field is still limited.
