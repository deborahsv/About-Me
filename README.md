# About-Me
Cover letter

- ðŸ‘‹ My name is DÃ©borah S. Vieira, and i am 21 years old. I am from Brazil. I completed high school in 2019 and began pursuing a bachelor's degree in Biomedicine. However, I decided to discontinue my studies in Biomedicine with only one year left to finish the program. Despite being close to completion, I realized that I no longer identified with the profession and felt dissatisfied.

- ðŸ“š I discovered computer science through freeCodeCamp, and I immediately fell in love with it. Initially, I thought it would be impossible for me to succeed in this field because i had never been proficient in exact sciences. However, I learned that dedication and perseverance are more important than innate talent. I have just started my journey in computer science, currently focusing on the basics such as HTML and CSS.

- ðŸ’» I am currently seeking an internship opportunity, although I acknowledge that my knowledge in the field is still limited.

- ðŸ“§ You can find my LinkedIn profile at: https://www.linkedin.com/in/d%C3%A9borah-vieira-2b57561a1/. Please note that my LinkedIn profile is currently in Portuguese as I am actively studying and practicing English to improve my proficiency until I feel confident enough to switch to English.

- âš¡ I am eager to contribute and learn in a dynamic and challenging environment.
